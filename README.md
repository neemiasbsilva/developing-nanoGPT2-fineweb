## About

Developing a custom nano GPT-2 from scratch using PyTorch an train in the EduFineWeb dataset. This repository was based on reproduce the [Open AI GPT-2 paper](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf) and using the hyper-parameters for trianing from [Open AI GPT-3 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165). The dataset used was the [FineWeb 🍷](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb) (the smalest version around 10B gpt2 number of tokens).

**Note**: This experiments was based on [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai) works, called [nano GPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT).

--------

## Usage

Clone the repository and create a conda environment:

```
pip install requirements.txt
conda env create --name envname --file=environments.yml
```

After that, open the file config_inf.yaml (`src/config/config_inference.yaml`) and choose the message you want (e.g `message: "Hello GPT, I want you to explain linear regression"`)

And finally, for run the inference (don't need a GPU for run), just type this command:
```
python generate.py
```

The text generation will be stored in `reports/generation.json`:

```
